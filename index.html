			About us
		</h2>
		<p>
			test
			Established on the Oudekerksplein you’ll find a cutting-edge
			and incomparable eatery run by a crazy bunch of passionate
			people from Italy. A mix of contemporary and the modern Italian
			cuisine, where excellent wines and groundbreaking cocktails
			join forces. Lolo is out of the ordinary, yet homelike. Joyfull,
			lush and funky at night, with house made playlists and a homelike
			vibe.

			Chi mangia solo crepa solo
		</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to Lolo's Italian restaurant, where we passionately bring the
			flavors of Italy to life. Dishes such as creamy burrata, risotto al
			merluzzo, and papardelle napolitana let you enjoy la dolce vita.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our head chef combines traditional cooking techniques with modern
			influences, all made from fresh Italian ingredients.
		</p>
		<p>
			Italy is not only tasted in our dishes but also in our cocktails.
			For the aficionados, we have unique creations like Limon Tette, a
			Baciami, or a Negroni - classic or with a twist. At Lolo, the quality
			of taste is paramount, both in our dishes and in Lolo’s cocktails.
